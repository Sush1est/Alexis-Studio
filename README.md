Hello! Since I dont know how to change
the description, I'll give you the
updated one. To use Alexis Studio, download
the html file and make sure when saving 
to your device that, 1: the file name
doesnt have .txt in it and 2: set file type
to any file or smth. (These instructions
are for Windows only.)
